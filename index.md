## About me

I am a second year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California - Riverside in [Prof. Luat Vuong's](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/luatv) [lab](https://nanochiral.engr.ucr.edu/). Where my research interests are in Machine Vision, Optical State Estimation, and mathematical complexity. 

Before starting my PhD I worked as a Chemical Process Engineer in the Pharmaceutical Industry.

I graduated with a MSE in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Massachussetts - Lowell in 2020, two years after I graduated with a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering from the University of New Hampshire.
